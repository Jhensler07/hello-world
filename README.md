starting out

Hello

I have been a computer person as long as I can remember. When I was 14 I started building maps for pc games and loved it, however between school, sports, and other high school things I drifted away from it. I have since been involved with building computers and still do play games, but not so much the coding aspect of it. I have wanted to get back into it for some time and am finally brushing up on my old HTML knowledge along with learning other languages. GitHub seems to be pretty ubiquitous and so here I am.
